Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database for a music school, focusing on the ability to efficiently handle queries for operational insights. This included queries such as calculating the total number of lessons per month over a year or listing all ensembles booked for the upcoming week for example. The database was populated with synthetic data to simulate real-world usage scenarios. These tasks were part of the Data Storage Paradigms course IV1351.
